### Summary: ### 
I started learning HTML and CSS with htmlAcademy courses. In February, 2019 I got to know about RS School and new resource for me – CodeAcademy. I went through HTML and CSS courses there. 
I am self-motivated and self-educating person. I obtain new skills quickly. Though it took some time to understand coding process.  I am interested in applying everything I've learned so far. I found it exciting and challenging.
